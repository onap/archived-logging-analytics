# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Name of the Elasticsearch cluster.
# A node can only join a cluster when it shares its cluster.name with all the other nodes in the cluster. 
# The default name is elasticsearch, but you should change it to an appropriate name which describes the 
# purpose of the cluster. 
#
cluster.name: $cluster.name
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# It is better to provide different meaningfull names fot different elastic nodes.
# By default, Elasticsearch will take the 7 first character of the randomly generated uuid used as the node id. 
# Note that the node id is persisted and does not change when a node restarts
#
#node.name: $node.name
#
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node. Can hold multiple locations separated by coma.
# In production, we should not keep this fixed, as on upgrading Elasticsearch, directory structure 
# may change & can deal to data loss.
path.data: /usr/share/elasticsearch/data
#
# Elasticsearch's log files location. In production, we should not keep this default to "/elasticsearch/logs", 
# as on upgrading Elasticsearch, directory structure may change.
path.logs: /usr/share/elasticsearch/logs
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# It is vitally important to the health of your node that none of the JVM is ever swapped out to disk. 
# Lock the memory on startup.
#
bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
# This IP is published for TCP & HTTP communications.
# HTTP is used for REST communications.
# TCP is used for communication between Elasticsearch cluster nodes
# If you have different different IPs for TCP & HTTP, you have to declare "transport.publish_host" & "http.publish_host"
# More info: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html
network.publish_host: $network.publish_host
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
# In order to communicate and to form a cluster with nodes on other servers, your node will need to bind to a 
# non-loopback address. 
#network.host: "0.0.0.0"  
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP: If required, default is 9200-9300
# This is used for REST APIs
http.port: $http.port
#
# Port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a range. 
# If a range is specified, the node will bind to the first available port in the range.
# Defaults to 9300-9400.
# More info: 
transport.tcp.port: $transport.tcp.port
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when new node is started:
# To form a cluster with nodes on other servers, you have to provide a seed list of other nodes in the cluster 
# that are likely to be live and contactable. 
# By default, Elasticsearch will bind to the available loopback addresses and will scan ports 9300 to 9305 to try 
# to connect to other nodes running on the same server.
#
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: $discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts
#
# This setting tells Elasticsearch to not elect a master unless there are enough master-eligible nodes  
# available. Only then will an election take place.
# Prevent the "split brain" by configuring the majority of nodes (total number of master-eligible nodes / 2 + 1):
discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2
#
# For more information, consult the zen discovery module documentation.
